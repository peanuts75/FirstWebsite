        <h2>I like food, such as:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
                <ul><li>especially when spicy</li></ul>
            <li>Chips</li>
                <ul><li>the british kind, not crisps</li>
                    <ul><li>though, they can be good, too</li>
                        <ul><li>unless they're green salt and vinegar</li></ul>
                        <ul><li>(that seems to mean more vinegar than salt)</li></ul></ul></ul>
            <li>Sweets</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>I like Avatar: the Last Airbender</h2>
        <p>If I had to order the series by preference, they'd look like this:</p>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Book 2: Where things were heating up</li>
            <li>Book 3: The final confrontation</li>
            <li>Book 1: The beginning of the saga</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>I like Code Nation</h2>
        <p>I've always wanted to create software, when I came across this place I was definitely interested. Over time (not much of it) I started to love this place.</p>
        <h2>My targets on week 1</h2>
        <p>I've made an effort to keep on track with the rest of the group as much as possible, but also to explore unfamiliar topics as much as possible. I've done this, and enjoyed it.</p>
